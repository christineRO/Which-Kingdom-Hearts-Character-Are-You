                <p>The innocent main character with a heart of gold who's just willing to help out with anything! This young man has the capability to seal the darkness, and open up new worlds leading to new possibilities. Like Sora, you have a charistmatic character that just makes everyone you meet into a friend that's willing to support you!</p>

                <p>The one who had fallen to darkness, but returned to light with the help of his friends. You are the type to depend on those around you! Most of the time you seem like you've got things handled, but you actually yearn for your friend's help. You're friends are actually really supportive, and help you out more than you think!</p>

                <p>The damsel in distress, the one who is willing to change and fight to be of some use, you wish to change to help everyone around you! As one of the seven princesses of heart, your heart cannot be consumed by the darkness! Not only that, but perhaps this may be because you're actually... a princess!?</p>
